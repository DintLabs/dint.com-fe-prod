            We may also make other changes to any part of the Terms of Service,

            b. You will make sure that all information which you submit to us is

            <br />
            We will use reasonable care and skill in providing Dint to you, but
            there are certain things which we are not responsible for, as
            follows:
            <br />
            a. We do not authorize or approve Content on Dint, and views
            expressed by Users on Dint do not necessarily represent our views.
            b. We do not grant you any rights in relation to Content. Any such
            rights may only be granted to you by Users. c. Your Content may be
            viewed by individuals that recognise your identity. We will not in
            any way be responsible to you if you are identified from your
            Content. While we may, from time to time and in our sole discretion,
            offer certain geofencing or geolocation technology on Dint, you
            understand and agree that we do not guarantee the accuracy or
            effectiveness of such technology, and you will have no claim against
            us arising from your use of or reliance upon any geofencing or
            geolocation technology on Dint.
            <br />
            d. All Content is created, selected, and provided by Users and not
            by us. We are not responsible for reviewing or moderating Content,
            and we do not select or modify the Content that is stored or
            transmitted via Dint. We are under no obligation to monitor Content
            or to detect breaches of the Terms of Service.
            <br />
            e. You agree that you have no obligation to follow any suggestions,
            comments, reviews, or instructions received from another User of
            Dint and that if you choose to do so, you do so entirely at your own
            risk.
            <br />
            f. We make no promises or guarantees of any kind that Users or
            Referring Users will make a particular sum of money (or any money)
            from their use of Dint (including the Dint Referral Program).
            <br />
            g. The materials which we make accessible on Dint for Users are for
            general information only. We make no promises or guarantees about
            the accuracy or otherwise of such materials, or that Users will
            achieve any particular result or outcome from using such materials.
            <br />
            h. We do not promise that Dint is compatible with all devices and
            operating systems. You are responsible for configuring your
            information technology, device, and computer programs to access
            Dint. You should use your own virus protection software.
            <br />
            i. We are not responsible for the availability of the internet, or
            any errors in your connections, device or other equipment, or
            software that may occur in relation to your use of Dint.
            <br />
            j. While we try to make sure that Dint is secure and free from bugs
            and viruses, we cannot promise that it will be and have no control
            over the Content that is supplied by Users.
            <br />
            k. We are not responsible for any lost, stolen, or compromised User
            accounts, passwords, email accounts, or any resulting unauthorized
            activities or resulting unauthorized payments or withdrawals of
            funds.
            <br />
            L. You acknowledge that once your Content is posted on Dint, we
            cannot control and will not be responsible to you for the use which
            other Users or third parties make of such Content. You can delete
            your account at any time, but you acknowledge that deleting your
            account will not of itself prevent the circulation of any of your
            Content which may have been recorded by other Users in breach of the
            Terms of Service or by third parties prior to the deletion of your
            account.

            <br />
            a. You confirm that you own all intellectual property rights
            (examples of which are copyright and trademarks) in your Content or
            that you have obtained all necessary rights to your Content which
            are required to grant licenses in respect of your Content to us and
            to other Users. This includes any rights required to engage in the
            acts covered by sub-section 10(b) below in any territory in which
            Dint is accessible and, in particular, in the United States of
            America, the United Kingdom and the European Union.
            <br />
            b. You agree to grant us a license under all your Content to perform
            any act restricted by any intellectual property right (including
            copyright) in such Content, for any purpose reasonably related to
            the provision and operation of Dint. Such acts include to reproduce,
            make available and communicate to the public, display, perform,
            distribute, translate, and create adaptations or derivative works of
            your Content, and otherwise deal in your Content.
            <br />
            c .The license which you grant to us under sub-section 10(b) above
            is perpetual, non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, sublicensable,
            assignable and transferable by us. This means that the license will
            continue even after your agreement with us ends and you stop using
            Dint, that we do not have to pay you for the license, and that we
            can grant a sub-license of your Content to someone else or assign or
            transfer the license to someone else. This license will allow us,
            for example, to add stickers, text, and watermarks to your Content,
            to make your Content available to other Users of Dint, as well as to
            use your Content for other normal operations of Dint. We will never
            sell your Content to other platforms, though we may sell or transfer
            any license you grant to us in the Terms of Service in the event of
            a sale of our company or its assets to a third party.
            <br />
            d. Whilst we do not own your Content, you grant us the limited right
            to submit notifications of infringement (including of copyright or
            trademark) on your behalf to any third-party website or service that
            hosts or is otherwise dealing in infringing copies of your Content
            without your permission. Although we are not under any obligation to
            do so, we may at any time submit or withdraw any such notification
            to any third-party website or service where we consider it
            appropriate to do so. However, we do not and are under no obligation
            to police infringements of your Content. You agree that if we
            request, you will provide us with all consents and other information
            which we reasonably need to submit notifications of infringement on
            your behalf. <br />
            e. You waive any moral rights which you may have under any
            applicable law to object to derogatory treatment of any Content
            posted by you on Dint. This waiver does not affect in any way your
            ownership of any intellectual property rights in your Content or the
            rights which you have to prevent your Content from being copied
            without your permission. The waiver is intended to allow us when
            dealing with your Content (as permitted by the license which you
            give us in section 10(b) above) to add watermarks, stickers or text
            to your Content.

            a. Links to Dint:
            <br />
            &#8226; You may link to the Dint homepage, provided you do so in a
            way that is fair and legal and does not damage our reputation or
            take advantage of it, but you must not establish a link in such a
            way as to suggest any form of association, approval, or endorsement
            on our part. &#8226; When promoting your Content you must comply
            with our Terms of Service and the terms of service of any other
            website where you place a link to or otherwise promote your User
            account. When promoting your content, you must not impersonate Dint
            or give the impression that your User account is being promoted by
            us if this is not the case. You must not promote your Dint account
            by using Google Ads or any similar advertising platform or search
            engine advertising service.

            b. Links from Dint: <br />
            &#8226; If Dint contains links to other sites and resources provided
            by third parties, these links are provided for your convenience
            only. Such links should not be interpreted as approval by us of
            those linked websites or information you may obtain from them. We
            have no control over the contents of those sites or resources and
            accept no responsibility for them or for any loss or damage that may
            arise from your use of them. If you decide to access any of the

            risk and subject to the terms and conditions of use for such
            websites. Domain Names: In some instances, Dint may allow Users to
            register or use domain names that contain the Dint trademark or a
            confusingly similar term. However, you will not register such a
            domain name, unless:
            <br />
            <br />
            &#8226; The domain name is registered by the User. &#8226; The

            names containing the Dint trademark or a confusingly similar term
            must not direct to any other website, including link aggregators.
            &#8226; The User obtains prior written permission from Dint and
            signs a licensing agreement.

            If you would like to register a domain name containing the Dint
            trademark or a confusingly similar term, please contact
            support@dint.com. Failing to comply with these provisions or the
            licensing agreement will be considered a violation of the licensing
            agreement and may result in Dint filing a domain dispute against the
            registrant.

            17. <b>Referral payments:</b> <br />
            a. How are referral payments calculated? The Dint Referral Program
            is a referral program offered by Dint, allowing existing users to
            earn referral payments by introducing new users to the platform.
            Only active users with a User account on Dint are eligible to
            participate in the program. The user must have a bank account or
            payment method linked to their account in order to receive referral
            payments. The user has a unique referral link that can be shared
            with others. The referred user must register via the referral link
            and not have previously been a user of Dint. Referral payments are
            calculated at 8% divided into 4 tiers, with a cap of $500,000 or ten
            years, whichever comes first, per referred user. Payments are
            transferred to the referring user's Dint Wallet immediately.
            <br />
            b. Choosing a payout method to receive referral payments: In order
            to be able to receive referral payments you must first choose one of
            the payout methods provided by Dint in your country of residence.
            These methods are called "Payout Options".
            <br />
            c. Who bears the cost of the referral payment? The cost of the
            referral payment is borne by us, not the Referred User.
