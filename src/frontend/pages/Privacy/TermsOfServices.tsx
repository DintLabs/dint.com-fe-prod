            a. You confirm that you own all intellectual property rights
            (examples of which are copyright and trademarks) in your Content or
            that you have obtained all necessary rights to your Content which
            are required to grant licenses in respect of your Content to us and
            to other Users. This includes any rights required to engage in the
            acts covered by sub-section 10(b) below in any territory in which
            <span className="notranslate">Dint</span> is accessible and, in particular, in the United States of
            America, the United Kingdom and the European Union.
            <br />
            b. You agree to grant us a license under all your Content to perform
            any act restricted by any intellectual property right (including
            copyright) in such Content, for any purpose reasonably related to
            the provision and operation of <span className="notranslate">Dint</span>. Such acts include to reproduce,
            make available and communicate to the public, display, perform,
            distribute, translate, and create adaptations or derivative works of
            your Content, and otherwise deal in your Content.
            <br />
            c .The license which you grant to us under sub-section 10(b) above
            is perpetual, non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, sublicensable,
            assignable and transferable by us. This means that the license will
            continue even after your agreement with us ends and you stop using
            <span className="notranslate">Dint</span>, that we do not have to pay you for the license, and that we
            can grant a sub-license of your Content to someone else or assign or
            transfer the license to someone else. This license will allow us,
            for example, to add stickers, text, and watermarks to your Content,
            to make your Content available to other Users of <span className="notranslate">Dint</span>, as well as to
            use your Content for other normal operations of <span className="notranslate">Dint</span>. We will never
            sell your Content to other platforms, though we may sell or transfer
            any license you grant to us in the Terms of Service in the event of
            a sale of our company or its assets to a third party.
            <br />
            d. Whilst we do not own your Content, you grant us the limited right
            to submit notifications of infringement (including of copyright or
            trademark) on your behalf to any third-party website or service that
            hosts or is otherwise dealing in infringing copies of your Content
            without your permission. Although we are not under any obligation to
            do so, we may at any time submit or withdraw any such notification
            to any third-party website or service where we consider it
            appropriate to do so. However, we do not and are under no obligation
            to police infringements of your Content. You agree that if we
            request, you will provide us with all consents and other information
            which we reasonably need to submit notifications of infringement on
            your behalf. <br />
            e. You waive any moral rights which you may have under any
            applicable law to object to derogatory treatment of any Content
            posted by you on <span className="notranslate">Dint</span>. This waiver does not affect in any way your
            ownership of any intellectual property rights in your Content or the
            rights which you have to prevent your Content from being copied
            without your permission. The waiver is intended to allow us when
            dealing with your Content (as permitted by the license which you
            give us in section 10(b) above) to add watermarks, stickers or text
            to your Content.

            16. <b>Payouts to Users:</b>
            <br />
            a. All User Payments will be received by a third-party payment
            provider approved by us.
            <br />
            b. If you have chosen the Stripe Payout Option, Stripe will collect
            the User Payment and pay the User Earnings to your bank account.
            <br />
            c. To make a withdrawal of User Earnings from your <span className="notranslate">Dint</span> Wallet, you
            must have at least the minimum balance amount in your <span className="notranslate">Dint</span> Wallet.
            Please click on withdrawal on your <span className="notranslate">Dint</span> Wallet page to see what the
            minimum payout amount is and Payout Option. <br />
            d. Users can click the withdrawal button on their wallet to
            automatically sell the tokens and have the funds deposited directly
            into their bank account.

            17. <b>Referral payments:</b> <br />
            a. How are referral payments calculated? The <span className="notranslate">Dint</span> Referral Program
            is a referral program offered by <span className="notranslate">Dint</span>, allowing existing users to
            earn referral payments by introducing new users to the platform.
            Only active users with a User account on <span className="notranslate">Dint</span> are eligible to
            participate in the program. The user must have a bank account or
            payment method linked to their account in order to receive referral
            payments. The user has a unique referral link that can be shared
            with others. The referred user must register via the referral link
            and not have previously been a user of <span className="notranslate">Dint</span>. Referral payments are
            calculated at 8% divided into 4 tiers, with a cap of $500,000 or ten
            years, whichever comes first, per referred user. Payments are
            transferred to the referring user's <span className="notranslate">Dint</span> Wallet immediately.
            <br />
            b. Choosing a payout method to receive referral payments: In order
            to be able to receive referral payments you must first choose one of
            the payout methods provided by <span className="notranslate">Dint</span> in your country of residence.
            These methods are called "Payout Options".
            <br />
            c. Who bears the cost of the referral payment? The cost of the
            referral payment is borne by us, not the Referred User.
